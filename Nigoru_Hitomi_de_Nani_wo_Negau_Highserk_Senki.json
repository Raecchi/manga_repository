  "description": "One day, Raizou ​​Takakura, an average salaryman, had a heart attack and his life ended that day. But, he got a second life in a different world. Reincarnated with strong skills― wasn't what happened to him. Instead, he was reincarnated as a foot soldier in a small country, Highserk Empire, which is surrounded by large countries. With a new name, Walm, he was thrown into the frontlines of a war. Covered in blood and stench of death, along his comrades, he was slipping through the life-or-death situations.",
